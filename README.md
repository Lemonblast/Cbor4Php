# Cbor4Php

[CBOR](http://cbor.io/) (Concise Binary Object Representation) is a tiny data format that can be used in place of JSON. Cbor4Php is a simple CBOR encoder/decoder for PHP.

## Installation
To install the library through composer, you simply need to add the following to `composer.json` and run `composer update`:

```JavaScript
{
    "require": {
       "lemonblast/cbor4php": "dev-master"
    }
}
```
Once installed, you can use the Cbor class (`Lemonblast\Cbor4Php\Cbor`) to encode and decode CBOR data.
